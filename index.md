## Overview

**songR** is a SONG-inspired dimensionality-reduction tool for R. It
implements the [Self-Organizing Nebulous Growths
(SONG)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3023941) algorithm of
Senanayake et al. (2021) natively in R and C++ (no Python or
`reticulate`), staying as close to the reference implementation as is
feasible.

SONG’s key advantages over t-SNE and UMAP:

| Feature                 | SONG           | t-SNE | UMAP     |
|-------------------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| **Incremental updates** | Yes            | No    | No       |
| **Parametric model**    | Yes (codebook) | No    | Optional |
| **Noise robustness**    | High           | Low   | Medium   |
| **Global structure**    | Good           | Poor  | Good     |

New data can be added to an existing embedding without reinitializing or
retraining the model, making SONG ideal for streaming data, growing
datasets, and experiments where data arrives in batches.

## Fidelity to the reference implementation

songR is validated against the original Python SONG with a tiered set of
golden-fixture parity tests. The honest, layer-by-layer picture:

- **Deterministic components** (distances, nearest-coding-vector
  assignment, the rational-quadratic kernel `(a, b)`, growth thresholds)
  reproduce the reference to **≤ 1e-5** (the float32-vs-double floor).
- **The core SONG embedding** (`dispersion = FALSE`) is **statistically
  identical** to the reference — e.g. AMI 0.949 = 0.949.
- **The default visualization** (`dispersion = TRUE`) uses a **stronger
  UMAP refinement** than the reference’s gentle one. songR’s raw
  embedding is more collapsed on hard, multi-class data, so the stronger
  refinement is needed to use the full plane — and it **matches or beats
  the reference’s AMI on every benchmarked dataset** (MNIST,
  Fashion-MNIST, COIL-20, Samusik, Wong), while staying competitive with
  t-SNE and UMAP.

Bit-identical embeddings are neither targeted nor achievable (the
reference is `float32` + numba `fastmath` + two PRNG streams). See the
[reference-parity
summary](https://cttir.github.io/songR/tests/testthat/fixtures/reference/PARITY.md)
and the parity tests (`tests/testthat/test-reference-parity.R`) for the
evidence.

## Installation

``` r

# Install from CRAN (when available)
install.packages("songR")

# Or install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cttir/songR")
```

## Quick Start

``` r

library(songR)

# Fit a SONG model
model <- song(as.matrix(iris[, 1:4]), seed = 42)
plot(model, color_by = iris$Species)

# Incremental update with new data
model <- update(model, new_data_matrix)

# Project new points into existing embedding
new_coords <- predict(model, newdata = held_out_matrix)
```

## Key Features

### Incremental Visualization

Train on an initial batch, then add more data without recomputing from
scratch. Existing point positions are preserved:

``` r

# Train on first batch
model <- song(batch1, epochs = 20L, seed = 42)

# Add second batch -- existing embedding is preserved
model <- update(model, batch2, epochs = 20L)

# Get embedding for ALL points
emb <- predict(model, newdata = rbind(batch1, batch2))
```

### Parametric Projection

Once trained, a SONG model can project unseen data without retraining:

``` r

new_coords <- predict(model, newdata = held_out_data)
```

### Bundled Dataset

songR ships with `songR_blobs`, a synthetic 8-cluster dataset in 20
dimensions for quick benchmarking:

``` r

data(songR_blobs)
model <- song(songR_blobs$data, epochs = 15L, seed = 42)
plot(model, color_by = songR_blobs$labels)
```

### Interactive Comparison App

Launch a Shiny app comparing SONG, t-SNE, and UMAP side-by-side with
dark mode support:

``` r

run_songR_app()
```

The app supports uploading custom data, tuning all SONG hyperparameters,
running incremental updates, and exporting embeddings and plots.

## When to Use SONG

- **Incremental/streaming data**: Data arrives in batches and you need a
  stable, growing visualization.
- **Heterogeneous increments**: New data may contain classes or
  structures not present in the original data.
- **Noisy or mixed clusters**: SONG is more tolerant to noise and
  cluster overlap than t-SNE.
- **Parametric mapping**: SONG retains a codebook model that can project
  new points without retraining.
- **Large-scale cytometry/single-cell**: SONG handles 1M+ cells
  incrementally with stable embeddings (see tutorials).

## Acknowledgments

This package is an independent R/C++ re-implementation of the SONG
algorithm using
[RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo). The
original algorithm was developed by Damith Senanayake, Wei Wang, Shalin
Naik, and Saman Halgamuge at the University of Melbourne. The original
Python implementation is available at
[github.com/damithsenanayake/SONG](https://github.com/damithsenanayake/SONG).

## Use of LLM tools

Portions of this package were prepared with assistance from large
language model tooling for narrowly defined, non-authorial tasks:
copyediting, prose smoothing, Markdown/LaTeX formatting, scaffolding of
boilerplate files (CI configs, build scripts), code refactoring. The
tools used were [Chat
AI](https://kisski.gwdg.de/leistungen/2-02-llm-service/), the LLM
service of KISSKI (GWDG), and a self-hosted **Mistral Small (24B,
Apache-2.0)** run locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and the
`ollamar` R package — local inference only, with no data sent to third
parties for the self-hosted model.

All scientific claims, methodological choices, analyses,
interpretations, and conclusions are the author’s own. No LLM-generated
text was incorporated without review and revision, and every reference
was verified against its DOI, arXiv ID, or ISBN.
